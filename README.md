### Calculator (2025)

Detailed description: This calculator is a graphical application built using Processing, designed to simulate the look and behavior of a basic handheld calculator. It features a clean and colorful interface with interactive buttons for digits 0 through 9, basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), and several special functions including square root, square, percentage, the value of π, a sign toggle (±), and a decimal point. A display screen at the top shows the current input or result, and a clear (C) button resets all values. The calculator handles input by storing two operands and an operator, allowing users to perform calculations by entering a number, selecting an operation, entering a second number, and pressing the equals button to display the result. The application uses arrays to manage the buttons and responds to mouse interactions to update the display and perform calculations accordingly.
